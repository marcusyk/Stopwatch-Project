This is the second project I created during the summer that features a stopwatch. The stopwatch is fully functional; it can start, stop, and reset a timer.

In HTML, I created the buttons and display timer. In CSS, I made the transitions of the buttons and the entire display. In JavaScript, I coded the functionality of the buttons and their effects on the display relative to their purpose. There was more JavaScript involved in this project than the Calculator Project and was able to learn more about the purpose and significance of JavaScript in my code.
